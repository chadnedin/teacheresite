          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="muted">Broad-Based Technology (Computer Studies) — Bachelor of Education Candidate</p>
          <p>My name is Chad Nedin, and I am a teacher candidate in the Bachelor of Education program with a teachable in Broad-Based Technology (Computer Studies). My pathway into education is grounded in both industry experience and postsecondary applied research, which strongly shapes how I approach teaching, learning, and student engagement.</p>
          <p>Before entering teacher education, I worked for several years in college-based applied research, including roles as an IT Researcher and Research Centre Coordinator. In these positions, I collaborated with faculty, students, and industry partners to design, build, and evaluate real-world technology solutions. This experience reinforced my belief that learning is most powerful when students can see clear, authentic connections between classroom content and the world beyond school.</p>
          <p>I also bring experience as a Teaching Assistant in Computer Studies, where I supported learners with a wide range of abilities, confidence levels, and prior exposure to technology. These experiences helped me develop a patient, supportive teaching style and a strong appreciation for scaffolded instruction, differentiated learning, and clear communication—especially for students who may not initially see themselves as “tech-savvy.”</p>
          <p>My teaching philosophy centers on the idea that technology education is not about memorizing tools, but about building problem-solving skills, digital literacy, and confidence. I aim to create classroom environments where students feel safe to experiment, make mistakes, and learn through doing. Whether students are coding, working with hardware, or analyzing the societal impacts of technology, I encourage curiosity, collaboration, and critical thinking.</p>
          <p>I am particularly interested in cross-curricular learning, integrating literacy, numeracy, and real-world contexts into technology lessons. Through project-based learning, service-learning opportunities, and hands-on activities, I strive to make technology accessible and meaningful for all learners—not just those who arrive with prior experience.</p>
          <p>As a future educator, I am committed to ongoing professional growth, reflective practice, and inclusive education. I see my role as both a teacher and a learner, continually adapting my practice to meet the needs of my students and to prepare them for an increasingly complex, technology-driven world.</p>
